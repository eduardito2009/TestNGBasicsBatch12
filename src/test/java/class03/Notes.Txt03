************************TestNG Class03********************

TestNG XML?
help us to control the execution of the test cases!!!!!


1.<suite>
      <test>
      		<classes>
      					<class name="class name"/>
      					<class name="class 1">
      									<methods>
      									      <inlcude name="test1"/>
      									</methods>
      					</class>
      		</classes>

      		<packages>
      				<package name= "packahe name"/>

      		</packages>
      </test>
</suite


*****when we run a specific method from a class , if ti has any before and after method they will also be executed even if we donot select them to run!!!!!


**executing our test cases on group level

1.When we execute in our XML using groups , by defualt the @beforeMethod and @afterMethod WILL NOT EXECUTE!!!
ONLY the methods tagged under that particular group will be executed!!!!!!

IN order to deal with this problem , becuase if we have any @BeforeMethod where we are doing some intializations we use the follwoing method
i.e
put (alwaysrun= "true") in front of your @beforeMethod and @AfterMethod

whenever you are running by groups and u get an error of NULL poitner Exception
the first thing to check is.....
"@beforeMethod is set to alwaysRUN=true"

--------------------------

Listeners:

Listeners class lsiten to events like test failed /pass /skipped e.t.c
once the testcase has executed
and it either fails /pass /skips
depending upon the status
listeneres class takes you to the execution of the code that you have written for the scenarios
if your test case fails/ pass or skips


Implentation of listeners class:

listeners class implements ITestListeneres
which is an interface from TestNG
and we overRide the functions according to our need

after that you need to link the listeners class to the class on which you want it to listen
that can be done using TextNG.XML

u define ur <listeners> tag just under <suite> and then write down the classes u want it to listen to.




DataProvider in TestNG:
Data provider is used for data driven testing.
use data provider for small data sets
for greater one use excel

if we want to declare our data set it must be under @dataProvider

if we want our test case to utilize this dataprovider
what do we need to do?
@test(dataprovider ="name of dataprovider")
public void test(){


}

Parallel Testing:
